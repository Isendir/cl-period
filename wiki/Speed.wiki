If you're going to be checking periods very often you really shouldn't use the string form directly in *`in-period-p`*, but should compile the period.  On an aged Sun Blade running SBCL:

{{{
PERIOD> (setf bob (compile-period-string "Monday-Friday.Hr9->17"))
(AND (:DAY-OF-WEEK-RANGE :MONDAY :FRIDAY) (:HOUR-RANGE 9 16))
PERIOD> (time (dotimes (i 5000)
                (in-period-p bob)))
